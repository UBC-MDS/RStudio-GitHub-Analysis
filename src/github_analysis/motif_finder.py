Sample usage (from project root dir): python src/github_analysis/motif_finder.py 0

Functions for implementing the following algo, suggested by Trevor Campbell:
To identify the K-node motifs in a graph, you could always use NetworkX and do something simple like:

Iterate:

sample a random node
pick a neighbor, add to the motif
keep adding neighbors of the motif until you reach K nodes
(if you want to keep track of frequencies:) compare to previously found motifs; increment the counter of this one by 1
