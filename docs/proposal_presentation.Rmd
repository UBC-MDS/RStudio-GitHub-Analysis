# Exploratory Data Analysis

# EDA Approach

- Use networkx to turn tabular data into graphs
  - Suggested by partner
- How we're defining nodes and edges
- Advantages
  - Ability to do directed graphs
  - Good for comparing projects and for visualizing subgraphs
  - Force-directed visualization algo 
  - Useful beyond EDA
- Limitations
  - Challenging to visualize the whole dataset
  - Limited customization options
  - Doesn’t have all graph operations (e.g. motifs)

# Analysis Introduction

- Ultimately trying to “find patterns in the way people actually use git”

- Ideal data to analyze

- Project-to-project comparison

- Finding common subgraphs

---
# Project-level analysis

## Graph2Vec Background 

![](../imgs/g2v_paper.png)

--

> "a neural embedding framework named graph2vec to learn data-driven distributed representations of arbitrary sized graphs."

--

> "graph2vec's embeddings are learnt in an unsupervised manner and are task agnostic."

---

## Graph2Vec Implementation and Limitations

![](../imgs/g2v_repo.png)

--
> Graph2Vec currently works with undirected graphs, therefore we will have to make modifications to support directed graphs.

--

> Graph2Vec only helps us address the first question (unless we can find a way to extract the learned subgraphs from the neural network).

- Approach - sub2vec - Juno
- Approach - genetic data - Juno
- Approach - social network - Juno

---
# Approach - Motifs

-  What’s a Motif?

  - A subgraph which occurs in a network at a much higher frequency than random chance

- Challenges with finding motifs

  - Relies on solving NP-complete problem of subgraph isomorphism

    - Potential Solution: MCMC sampling

  - Haven’t found many resources for identifying motifs
