# Introduction

- We want to understand how people use Git
    - What works for workflows
    - What is hindering workflows
    - What are those workflows?
    
--

- There are limitations to how we can approach this
    - We don't have access to local commands
    - We only have commits
        - How do we identify branching and merging?
            - Assumptions!

---

# Introduction

- How do we represent a history of commits?
    - Independent events?
    - Sequences?

### Graphs

# Introduction

- Git is not any type of graph, it is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
    - Nodes/Vertices --> Commits
    - Edges --> Connection from one commit to the other

# Introduction

- We aim to answer two questions:

--

### What are similar projects based on their commit history structure?

--

### What are common sub-patterns in the way people use Git?

# Getting the data

---
# Getting the data

- GitHub API
    - Sampling
    - Rate Limiting
- GitHub Torrent
    - Mines the GitHub API for all latest pushs
    - Tracks all of the repos and makes it available in a MySQL database
    - This means 4TB of overall data
--

---
# Getting the data

- Multiple tables containing information about projects, commits, users, issues, etc.
- Pipeline process:
    - Sample 1 million projects in the DB
    - Get the commits for all the projects
    - Get the parents of the commits for all the projects
    - Save to Buckets for export and storage
- Reproducibility in scope
    - SQL Versioning
    - Data Versioning

## Graph2Vec Background 

![](imgs/g2v_paper.png)

--

> "a neural embedding framework named graph2vec to learn data-driven distributed representations of arbitrary sized graphs."

--

> "graph2vec's embeddings are learnt in an unsupervised manner and are task agnostic."

---

## Graph2Vec Implementation and Limitations

![](imgs/g2v_repo.png)

--
> Graph2Vec currently works with undirected graphs, therefore we will have to make modifications to support directed graphs.

--

> Graph2Vec only helps us address the first question (unless we can find a way to extract the learned subgraphs from the neural network).

# Subgraph analysis

---

## Approach - `sub2vec`

- Based on `Weisfeiler-Lehman Graph Kernels`
  - iterate nodes and edges, relabel and group, represent the features in a vector

  ![](imgs/wl_kernel.png)
---

## Approach - `sub2vec`

- goal is to learn a feature representation of each subgraph, which allow the properties being maximized in the latent feature space

- preserve two properties

  - `Neighborhood`: neighborhood information of all the nodes, sets of all paths(annotated by node IDs)
  
  - `Structural`: the overall structure (clique, degree, size of subgraph)
  
- advantage: better accuracy, network embedding methods (Node2vec) preserve various node properties, but lack the properties of entire subgraphs

- disadvantage:  assume unweighted undirected graphs, but can be extended

---

## Approach - genetic data

- comparing to git workflow representation

  - similarity: sequence, i.e. directed
  
  - difference: fixed length, fixed variation (can apply one-hot encoding)

  ![](imgs/dna_matrix.png)
  
  ![](imgs/dna_encoding.png)

---

## Approach - genetic data

- current trend of genetic data study

  - DeepVariant
  
    - converting DNA sequences to images and feeding them through a convolutional neural network
    
    - identify small mutations, mostly changes of a single letter
    
    ![](imgs/dna_image.png)

---

## Approach - social network analysis (SNA)

- comparing to git workflow representation

  - similarity: directed
  
  - difference: goal is to predict linkage existence

- can learn from

  - the first step of SNA would be learning structural features of connected graph
  
  - using sequence generating algorithms: node2vec samples network neighborhoods of each node using the biased random walks
  
  - computational inefficient

---
## Approach - Motifs

-  What is a Motif?

  - A subgraph which occurs in a network at a much higher frequency than random chance
