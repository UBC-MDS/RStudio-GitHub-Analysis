<p>We are a group of students from 2018-2019 UBC Master of Data Science (MDS) program. The program involves capstone projects during its last two months, when students work in teams with an external partner and a UBC mentor to address a question facing the partner using data science.</p>

<p>RStudio is interested in developing a new tool for Git users that improves and consolidates common Git workflows. Our partner, Dr. Greg Wilson from RStudio, suggested that to understand what should be included in the alternative tool, data analysis should be performed first on what is currently being done by Git users. This is where our project comes in.</p>

<p>Our project aims to identify common Git workflows, with the end goal of using our understanding of these workflows to provide recommendations for features that should or should not be included in an easy-to-use Git alternative.</p>

<p>Dr. Tiffany Timbers is our mentor for this project, who also teaches, develops curriculum and coordinates the MDS program.Â She has been providing constructive feedback and directional advice throughout our project.</p>
