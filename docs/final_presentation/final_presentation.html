## Our Partner's Idea

- Get data for a large number of projects from GitHub.

--

- Identify branching and merging patterns using any statistical or machine learning approach on the commit history of the graphs

--

- Select a small set of common subgraphs that account for a large fraction of everyday use

--

- Build a tool to support those most common subgraphs

--

- **Profit.** Well, fame. OK, will you settle for having made the world a better place?

## Our Role

To build the tool, we need to understand how people use Git
- What works for workflows
- What is hindering workflows
- **What are those workflows?**
    
We only have **data** to answer one of these questions
- Access to commit history
- This enables us to draw up recommendations for the new tool that RStudio is interested in developing.

# Questions

---
class: inverse, center

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

## Question 1

### Are there identifiable workflow patterns in the way people use git?

--

## Question 2

### What are common subgraphs that account for a large fraction of everyday use?

---
## Approach to Identifying Workflow Patterns

- Unsupervised Learning

--

- Natural Language Processing

--

![](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/260/099/be0.png)

---
## Challenges

- Working with graph data is a new (the algorithm we're using was published in **late 2018**)

--

- We need to convert this data to something we can work with and cluster

--

- Natural Language Processing also has this problem

---

## Greater than 10 commits

## Greater than 100 commits

![](gt_100_commits.png)

---

## Are there identifiable workflow patterns?

--

**Yes**

--

Are they useful?

--

**Not really**, they're mostly just git init's...

--

Out of 36.4 million projects

|            | &gt; 1 Commit    | &gt; 1 Author   |
|------------|---------------|--------------|
| # Projects | 19.03 million | 5.19 million |
| % Total    | 52.29%        | 14.27%       |

--

Moving forward, we'll be looking at projects with **&gt; 100 commits**

So why don't we only cluster on large projects?

---
## Clustering on 100+ commits

.pull-left[
- Due to the variability in large projects, our approach is unable to find clear clusters.

- This doesn't mean we can't do anything with this result, it just requires a deeper analysis and future work.

## Approach to Identifying Common Subgraphs

- Question 2: What are common subgraphs that account for a large fraction of everyday Git use?

--

&lt;div style="text-align: left"&gt;
- Looked the most common motifs in Git projects with 100+ commits.
 - Motifs: Subgraphs that appear in a network at a much higher frequency than random chance.

--

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;img src="motif_example.png"&gt;

---
## Challenges

&lt;div style="text-align: left"&gt;
- It's challenging to associate similar (but not identical) motifs together.
    - Leads to a lot of noise in the data.
- For example, you can see that the motifs below are all similar to one another.
 - No easy way to associate them algorthmically.
 - Challenging to do visually for longer motifs. 
 
&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;img src="similar_motifs.png"&gt;

--
&lt;div style="text-align: left"&gt;
- Shorter motifs generated from Git graphs consists of mostly single chains (no branching or merging)

---
## Choosing Motif Length to Analyze

- Given these challenges, what motif length should we study?
 - Looked at what percentage of projects in our dataset had motifs with at least one branch or merge for different motif lengths.
 
&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;img src="mcp_histograms.png"&gt;

--

&lt;div style="text-align: left"&gt;
- Answer: Study motif lengths 25 and 5.
 - Motifs length 25 are the shortest chain lengths that aren't overwhelmed by single chains.
 - Motif length 5, despite consisting of mostly single chains, are useful for seeing small patterns visually.
 
---
## Most Common Git Motifs

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;img src="motif_5_visual.png"&gt;

---
## Most Common Git Motifs

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;img src="motif_25_visual.png"&gt;

---

## Key Findings

- Many branches that are created aren't merged back in within the next 5 or 25 commits.

 - 42% of motifs length 5 and 13% of motifs length 25 that start with a branch don't contain a single merge.

 - There is 1.41x more branches than merges in the dataset overall.


--

&lt;br /&gt;  

- 84.3% of motifs length 5 and 56.1% of motifs length 25 are a single chain (no branching or merging). 

 - Many large projects consist of mostly single chains. Are these projects fundamentally different than projects with branching and merging?

---

## Secondary Finding: A Project's Graph Complexity is Related to it's Usage of GitHub Features

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;img src="GH_features_by_complexity.png"&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: left"&gt;
- GitHub projects with more complex graphs have more issues, pull requests, and code reviews than projects with simpler graphs.

---
## Limitations to answering both questions

- Squashing and Rebasing
- Public activity only
- GHTorrent data cleanliness and availability

---
## Summary


- Our questions were aimed to understand:
  - Identifiable workflow patterns in the way people use git
  - Common subgraphs that account for a large fraction of everyday use
  
- To do this we:
  - Performed clustering using Graph2Vec and K Means
  - Extracted motifs from the different projects

- Based on the insights extracted from the data we then divided our recommendations in three categories:
  - Confident
  - Tentative
  - Requires further exploration

# Recommendations 
---

## Confident Recommendations

- We see consistent language use in big projects between the largest 8 languages in our sample.
  - A new tool should be language agnostic as users tend to follow patterns not guided by languages.

- Many large projects are mainly single chains
  - A new tool should incorporate a centralized workflow with a branch from which the other branches derivate. (master branch)
  
---
## Tentative Recommendations 

- There is a positive correlation between complexity and GitHub feature usage
  - A new tool should direct users to use the documentation features such as issues and PR reviews to maintain a long term structure.

- Branching is 1.41x more prevalent than merging
  - A new tool should consider a mechanism to force users to keep up to date within a certain number of commits.
  
---
## Requires further exploration

- Couldn’t find evidence of the use of Git Flow or other types of pre-established workflows. 
  - An approach looking specifically for this patterns needs to be considered in order to determine if they are prevalent or not.

- Look at the relationship between the number of people contributing to a repository and the complexity that the project takes in the long run.

---
## Next Steps

- Study the causal relationship between GitHub feature usage and graph complexity
- Trace successful and large projects in the embeddings space
- Weight graphs with the time between commits
- Add graph node attributes such as authors within motifs
- Exclude motifs at beginning and end of graph
- Find repos that claim to use pre-established workflows
