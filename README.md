## Overview
This project aims to understand how people are currently using GitHub, with the eventual goal of building an easy-to-use alternative to Git.

This project includes the ability to cluster similar GitHub projects and pick out their most commonly-occuring subgraphs.

Motivation behind this project: http://third-bit.com/2017/09/30/git-graphs-and-engineering.html

## Usage
Run the following commands to reproduce this analysis:
```{bash}
snakemake get_ght_data # Downloads GH Torrent data from figshare. Be aware that the file is quite large, and downloading can take 1-2 hours.

snakemake run_analysis # Run our pipeline; generate embeddings, clusters, tsne graph, motif report, etc.

snakemake generate_images # Generate images of our most important findings.
```

To change parameters from the command line, simply put `--config param=value` after your snakemake call. For a full list of configurable parameters, see the `config.json` file in the root directory of this project. 
For example, if you wanted to run the analysis with 5 workers instead of the default, run:

```{bash}
snakemake run_analysis --config n_workers=5
```
 

### Example
From the root directory, run: 

```{bash}
python src/python src/github_analysis/main.py -dp "/home/rayce/Assignments/Capstone/RStudio-Data-Repository/clean_data/commits_by_org.feather".py
```

## Installation instructions
First, to get credentials file neccessary for pulling the GitHub Torrent from Google Cloud (necessary for re-generating images for our analysis):

- Follow the instructions under 'Set up a service account' to create and download a credentials file: https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/common/auth
- Change the name of the file to `credentials_file.json` and put it in the root directory of the project (a sample file with the name `credentials_file_EXAMPLE.json` is included as a reference).
